        Hi there! My name is Billy Zhu and I'm currently a junior, majoring in Information Science
        in the College of Arts and Sciences at Cornell University. I was born on October 5th, 1997
        in Queens, New York and have spent the majority of my life there. Fun fact, I have never
        really traveled-- in fact, I've never been on an airplane before. However, New York City
        is such a melting pot of culture and ideas that I do not have to travel far to experience
        the riches the world has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I like to tinker with code, watch movies and TV shows, hang out with friends,
        and play some pick-up basketball. My favorite films include: Shawshank Redemption,
        La La Land, The Batman Trilogy, and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. My favorite TV
        shows are: Fargo, Game of Thrones, The Office, and Westworld. I'm a very casual
        gamer and I also love to play a lot of Tetris! I am also very interested in technology.
        As a part-time job, I  work at the Cornell Store in the TechConnect department so
        feel free to stop by and pay me a visit!
      </p>
